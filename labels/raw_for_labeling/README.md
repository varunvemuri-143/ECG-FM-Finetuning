# Raw inputs for label creation

This directory holds raw inputs for the label-creation step. The label script expects **machine_measurements.csv** in MIMIC-IV-ECG format (e.g. `study_id`, `report_0`…`report_17`). Computed outputs are written to **labels/computed_labels/**. Raw ECG signals are not stored in this repository.
