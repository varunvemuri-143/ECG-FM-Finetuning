# ECG-FM pattern labeler (Python package)

Python package for the ECG-FM pattern-based text labeler, copied from the [ECG-FM](https://github.com/bowang-lab/ECG-FM) official repo so the labels stage runs without an external ECG-FM clone.

Used by `labels/scripts/create_labels_ecgfm.py` (script adds this directory to `sys.path` and imports `pattern_labeler`, `preprocess`, etc.). Do not modify unless you are syncing with a specific ECG-FM release.
